SocialBridge: Comprehensive Platform Overview Core Mission: SocialBridge is a MERN-stack platform built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js (using JavaScript and functional components), and Node.js. It features a Bootstrap CSS framework for a responsive UI platform engineered to deliver high-impact career mentorship. It replaces the problem of generic connections and low-quality advice with a system built on contextual, asynchronous 1:A Q&A. The core is an Intelligent Matching Algorithm, which uses detailed user input to compute a quantifiable Relevance Score, ensuring mentees are paired with the most qualified mentors for their specific career goals and struggles. Communication is structured and asynchronous to promote thoughtful, high-quality responses and auditable progress, avoiding the pressure of live chat. 1. User Experience and Engagement Onboarding: Both mentees and mentors complete a detailed form collecting structured data beyond basic skills and goals. This includes current and target career state, specific problems, priority goals, constraints, preferences, evidence fields (e.g., resume links), contextual questions, and learning style. Dashboards: Users access a personalized dashboard: Mentee Dashboard: Features a visual progress timeline from "Source" to "Destination," a list of milestones, action items, session summaries, an engagement meter, and a risk indicator to flag overdue tasks. Mentor Dashboard: Displays mentee progress cards, suggested responses, and quality/feedback statistics. Goal Setting & Progress: A hybrid approach uses a checklist of atomic tasks within a suggested mini-curriculum. Progress is tracked via the dashboard, with milestones, session themes, and action items closing the loop. If a mentee falls behind, an automated escalation flow sends nudges and alerts the mentor. Feedback Loops: Structured post-session forms allow both users to provide ratings and detailed feedback. This data informs the AI algorithm, influencing the Relevance Score and helping train the matching model. Safeguards are in place to prevent biased feedback from unfairly penalizing a mentor. Notifications: Multi-channel, behaviorally timed nudges include booking reminders, post-session summaries with action items, and re-engagement emails. Relying on users to "check us every day" is replaced with targeted, value-driven communications. Mentee Path Flexibility: The platform is designed for dynamic adaptation. Mentees can redefine goals, triggering the AI to recommend new mentors or adjust the learning path. 2. Monetization and Business Model Consumer Tiers: A tiered model offers a free 1-month trial with unlimited Q&A. The Pro tier (₹100/month) provides unlimited asynchronous Q&A, AI matching, session recordings, milestone templates, and community access. An optional Premium tier (₹499+/month) offers faster matching, a priority mentor pool, and advanced analytics. B2B / Enterprise: The B2B model features a per-seat annual subscription with volume discounts. It includes enterprise-level features like SSO, an admin dashboard with utilization and ROI metrics, HRIS integrations, and custom onboarding. Monetization Transition: Automated reminders and "value summary" emails showcase the progress made during the free trial, encouraging users to convert to a paid plan. 3. Mentor Quality and Community Recruitment & Vetting: Mentors are recruited through targeted outreach and partnerships. They undergo automated checks and human review, with an optional interview. A probation period monitors new mentors, and ongoing QA is maintained through audits and rating thresholds. Incentives & Compensation: A mix of non-monetary incentives (exposure, status) and optional paid programs (per-session or revenue share) ensures a steady, high-quality mentor supply. Community Building: While centered on 1:1 Q&A, the platform fosters a broader community through: Public Help Requests (Opt-in): Allows anonymized questions and answers to become a searchable resource. Topic Boards: Facilitates asynchronous group discussions. Curated Resource Library: Guides and templates provided by mentors. Gamification: Rewards constructive participation. Proof of Advice Quality: Quality is verified through AI-generated session summaries, 30/90-day outcome surveys, anonymized case studies, and a tiered badging system for mentors. 4. Technology and Ethics AI Scaling: The AI is trained using structured data and feedback loops. A ranking model computes the Relevance Score, and AI retraining cycles occur monthly. A Human Review Committee validates AI-flagged critical decisions. Infrastructure is managed via AWS auto-scaling and MongoDB Atlas. Privacy & Data Compliance: All user data is encrypted (both in transit and at rest). Automated Data Subject Request handling is implemented, and operations comply with GDPR and India's DPDP Act. Technical and operational measures include RBAC, penetration testing, and compliance with privacy laws. Moderation & Disputes: A transparent three-step dispute resolution process includes automated AI review, human review by an impartial panel, and a right to appeal. A Credibility Score discourages vexatious claims, and transparency logs are maintained. Legal Responsibility: The Terms of Service clarifies that SocialBridge is a facilitator and assumes no liability for advice outcomes, as mentors are independent contractors. The platform provides educational and professional guidance, with interpretation remaining the mentee’s discretion. Legal counsel will draft compliant terms and policies
